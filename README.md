# Vertigo Project

This is an upload of the Vertigo project (2017-2018) from my old laptop.

## About

This project used an inertial data logger to measure acceleration, position, and rate of rotation. What made Vertigo interesting was its ability to detect gravity and the Earth's magnetic field, calculating north and the downwards direction to work out its orientation in a world frame stored as a quaternion.

Scripts were written using MATLAB.
